 * Initialize standard file descriptors for a process.

 * user-level code.
 *
 * Specifically, the function opens the console device for input and output,
 * assigns the appropriate file handles to the file descriptors 0, 1, and 2 in
 * the given file table, and creates file handles for each of them. The standard
 * input is opened in read-only mode, while the standard output and standard
 * error are opened in write-only mode.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   ft - Pointer to the file table of the process being initialized.
 *
 * Returns:
 *   0 on success.
 *   ENOMEM if memory allocation fails for any of the file handles.
 *   Other error codes from vfs_open() if the console device cannot be opened.
 *
 * Errors:
 *   This function may fail if it cannot allocate memory for file handles or
 *   if it cannot open the console device. If an error occurs, the process
 *   file table may be partially initialized.
