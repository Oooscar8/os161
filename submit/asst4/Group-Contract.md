# Group Contract

> This file specifies each group member's contribution to Assignment4 and how we manage to merge our work together to submit A4.

## Code reading exercises

Alex Sun is responsible for writing solutions to exercises 1-8.

Jiayue Yang is responsible for writing solutions to exercises 9-16.

After we finish our work, we check each other's answers and reach an agreement.

## Code

When starting to write actual code, we decide to implement our own version of the whole assignment and merge our code together in the end.

Jiayue Yang works on branch `master` and Alex Sun works on branch `new-A4`.

In the end, we both successfully finish the whole coding assignment, including the file tables and 8 system calls, as shown on github. Both of our implementations pass all the tests.

After finishing our own implementations, instead of directly merging our code, we decide to work on branch `master` together(to save some troubles). We read each other's code and fix bugs together. In the end, we modify the code on branch `master` together to obtain a better code solution.
